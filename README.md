# Introduction
Hi! I’m Med Yassine Maghrebi (you can just call me Yassine), a 14-year-old developer, maker, and creative programmer.  
I love building things — from Arduino-powered robots to AI-driven apps — and I’m always experimenting. Sometimes it’s a serious automation project, other times it’s just a fun side build “because I can.” (I mean, who's gonna stop me ? :3)

This is my (not so) living portfolio: a mix of finished projects, prototypes, and experiments that show how I’ve been growing as a programmer.

# Conclusion
From microcontrollers to machine learning, from web frontends to prank scripts — this portfolio is a snapshot of my curiosity in action.  
Every project here taught me something new, and I’m just getting started.

Oh, and forgot to mention, these are not full time projects, programming is my dream but right now I treat it as a hobby (I'm focusing on studies), just keep in mind : Even if the projects look small, they could've taken weeks, and even if they look big, they could've taken less than a day :D

In short, just keep in mind, don't judge something by it's cover :
